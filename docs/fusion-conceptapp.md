## Access to application and data

Insert an access matrix or similar. Also include information about who have approved the access regime. Describe the user groups that have access. Use exiting concepts and groups when granting access and discuss this with PO/SME of app.  Also make sure that the access is given on the basis of data classification referenced in [WR0158](https://docmap.equinor.com/Docmap/page/doc/dmDocIndex.html?DOCKEYID=427318)

Example of groups / constallations of people:

    - Equinor Employee - All Equinior Employee
    - Equinor Account - This includes all @equinor in Azure AD
    - Everyone in Azure AD - All of the above and includes all affiliated. We do not know how all affiliated is.
- Participant of a project - Allocated to a Poroject that have the organization chart in fusuon.
- Member of an Azure AD group - example is  "All leaders in Equinor" , "Fusion Developers", etc.
